# How to use
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
2. Install the python packages `snappy` and `cramjam`
3. Run this script: `python firefox_metamask_seed_recovery.py`
4. If successful, something like this will be displayed:

   ```
   ---------------------------------------
   Probably found a Metamask vault:

   {"data":"m9b27bSJDFv5svrd7r76v/98nnv678b4TG6v8m+k0v998vnFf98nvfd9f==","iv":"8bbsvdG/G453==","salt":"AS6D/faas+8JJSD="}

   ---------------------------------------
   ```

8. You can now use the Vault Decryptor: https://metamask.github.io/vault-decryptor/ or BTCRecover https://github.com/3rdIteration/btcrecover/


If you recover funds, you may also want to tip the original author of this extraction script: `0xC5e9aCcd70FaEdafbe28D8b83DCCf5d3E9C8E527`
